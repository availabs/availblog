**Thanks to Hugo**, while we often build complex web applications built ontop of large databases and sophisticated data analysis tools, that's not always the best way to build a website focused on content.

## Why do we use it?

Hugo is a static site generator that lets us update our projects, staff and blog just using markdown files (and also TOML or JSON files) and compiles templates down to static html, css and js so that its a breeze to host ( on apache for example). This means that we'll be updating the site more frequently so check back soon.

## Where does it come from?

The internet.
