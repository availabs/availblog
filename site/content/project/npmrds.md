text: Working in coordination with New York State DOT and New York Metropolitan Planning Organizations, AVAIL is building a performance measurement dashboard based on NPMRDS. The NPMRDS Analytics Tool Suite provides you with the visualization tools you need to analyze and report network performance, run corridor analyses, and conduct project analyses at various geographic and temporal resolutions. AVAIL's NPMRDS Tools provide pinpoint Analysis of PM3 Measures to aid users in discovery of which TMCs are contributing negatively to your performance scores. The Tools allow users to track PM3 progress month over month and year over year and provides default templates for quick and easy analysis as well as highly customizable features for more in-depth analyses for publishing reports directly to the web.
