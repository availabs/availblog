text: AVAIL is developing a web-based traffic data analytics data administration module as part of a Federal Highways Administration Pooled Fund Study for six state DOTs (Connecticut, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, North Carolina and Michigan). The data administration module is an all inclusive transportation data visualization software suite focusing on continuous counts data, WIM and HPMS. The software will be made open-source upon completion and it is expected that the software will be used by transportation professionals around the US.
