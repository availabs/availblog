title: "MTA Real-time Data Conversion for Subway Info"
date: 2017-04-07T16:42:23.800Z
description: AVAIL was awarded a grant by the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to create an Application Programming Interface (API) that is capable of converting MTAâ€™s Subway system data, GTFS Realtime, on the fly into SIRI, the format used to publish their bus data. In recent years, the standardization of transit schedule information has yielded a dramatic increase in the accessibility of computerized transit schedules, and has brought about the availability of real-time service schedule. Currently, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) publishes its real-time transit data in two very different formats. This is due to system/vendor limitations. AVAIL will unify their data streams into one format in order to provide developers and travelers more complete access to real-time transit data in the largest mass transit market in the country.
